-   **Task**: Main task entities with status, priority, and categories
-   **NextAction**: Actionable steps associated with tasks
-   **WorkDone**: Work log entries for tasks and next actions
-   **Category**: Task categorization system

### Key Relationships

-   Users have many Tasks
-   Tasks have many NextActions and WorkDone entries
-   NextActions can have WorkDone entries
-   Tasks belong to Categories

## API Routes

-   `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
-   `GET /api/tasks/[id]` - Get task details

-   `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` - Delete task

### Next Actions

-   `GET /api/tasks/[id]/next-actions` - List task's next actions
-   `POST /api/tasks/[id]/next-actions` - Create next action
-   `GET /api/next-actions/[id]` - Get next action details
-   `PATCH /api/next-actions/[id]` - Update next action (toggle completion)

## Customization

### Adding New Task Statuses

Update the `TaskStatus` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING
  IN_PROGRESS
  COMPLETED
  ON_HOLD      // Add new status
}
```

### Custom Categories

Categories are user-manageable through the database. Consider adding a category management interface for your needs.

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS. Modify styles in component files or extend the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Development

### Database Changes

When modifying the Prisma schema:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### Adding New Components

Components are located in `app/components/`. Follow the existing patterns for consistency.

### API Route Structure

API routes follow Next.js 13+ App Router conventions in the `app/api/` directory.
